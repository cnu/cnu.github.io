These are a list of projects that I have worked on.

## **Sentiment Analysis**

When working for [Serendio][1], developed the core of the sentiment analysis engine. It can analyse plain text from various review sites, blogs, forums, etc., about a product and identify whether it is positive or negative. It can also can identify which features of the products customer talk and how positive or negative they feel about each feature in the product.

**Technologies Used:** Python 2.6, NLTK for Natural Language Parsing, PostgreSQL & Greenplum.

## **Extensible Crawler**

Part of the team which developed the crawler for gathering data from review sites, blogs, forums, etc. It was extensible for individual sites, where set of rules can determine what data to be extracted or ignored from the URL.

**Technologies Used:** Python 2.6, Turbogears web framework for REST APIs, Python MultiProcessing, PostgreSQL & Greenplum.

### [Longen][2]

An Open Source web service which can unshorten URLs from various shortening services like bit.ly, j.mp, etc.
  
[Source][3].

### [MontyLingua3][4]

GPL&#8217;ed Fork of the popular MontyLingua Project. Has an interesting history as the original source code had two [licenses][5] based on the purpose of the usage. It was free under [GNU GPL][6] for non-commercial use and for commercial use, a separate license was available upon contacting with the author.

The entire story is well described in my [blog about MontyLingua3][7]. Even though the code is not being actively developed, if anyone wants to use MontyLingua under GPL, download it from my [repository][8].
