The other day I was consolidating all my ideas in my Evernote and I found that I have noted down a lot of projects/ideas for products.

Some are so trivial and simple that if I could sit down I will be able to get a prototype or MVP out in a few hours or maximum a day. But I can&#8217;t seem to find the time or the resolve to do it.

What could I do to make sure that atleast a few of them come to fruition for the next year?
