Few weeks back I was introduced to a coding challenge called [#100DaysOfCode][1]. All you have to do is work on some piece of coding project which is not your work project everyday for 100 days. Though I liked the idea I didn&#8217;t commit to taking up the challenge. I thought I could start working on a side project or an open source project whenever I wanted to.

But deep down I knew it was not true. Saying &#8220;I can work on a side project whenever I want to&#8221; is just like me saying to myself &#8220;I can lose weight whenever I want to&#8221;. It will never get done unless you start it. Remember the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is today.

We all like to believe that we are rockstar programmers and we can sit through a 24 hour no-sleep coding session and build ourÂ next big thing. But in reality, Programming is a muscle that needs constant training and regular exercise to keep it in shape. It is a skill which will improve when you regularly do it and will degrade when you don&#8217;t do it.

So I decided to cut the BS and sit down and start the challenge today. The [original blog post about the challenge][2] says the detailed rules about the challenge. But since this is a personal challenge, I decide my own rules.

  1. Even though I prefer to release my code using an Open Source License, I will start the project as a private project and after it reaches some critical mass, I will decide to release it to the public.
  2. I will try to post everyday about the project and the status of the project here and/or a public issue tracker.
  3. Most of the projects will be very very small &#8211; some might be single page web apps or command line utilities. I don&#8217;t want to bite more than I can chew &#8211; at least in the initial stages of the challenge.

The next post will be about the first project and how I have started on it.
