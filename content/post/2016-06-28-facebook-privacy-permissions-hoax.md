If you had a facebook account, you would have seen at least 1 friend who had posted something like this sometime in the past 2 days.

This is not something that started yesterday. I have seen variants of this few years back and every time someone starts a chain and it spreads like wildfire.

A quick search for [facebook privacy hoax](https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+privacy+hoax) would show you how much of an idiot you were. 

The only thing that is legal and binding is the [Terms of Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy) that you read (you did read it right?) and agreed by clicking a check box when you registered for your facebook account. No status updates or posting on your wall can override that. 

A contract is legally binding only if both parties agree to it. Both parties here means "you" and "facebook". That is what you did when you checked the box during registration. What you are posting on your wall is a post just to show how dim-brained you are. 

Whenever you are not comfortable with the terms and conditions, you are free to stop using the service. No one is forcing you to be active on facebook, posting your status updates, checkins, photos, videos. If you hate that facebook is making money by selling you to it's advertisers, please leave. 

If you understand the stupidity of these people, please copy-paste the below message as a comment on their post. 
Feel free to edit it as you see fit.

> On Tuesday 28 June 2016, I proclaim to everyone that this person here is a stupid, dimwitted numbnut. This person is so gullible that s/he thinks that they can solve world hunger and cure cancer by liking some stupid post. These are the scums of the internet who need to be called out and publicly shamed. They took an IQ test and their result came back negative. 

> I could continue hurling insults at you, but I have better use of my time than trying to get some sense into your rat's ass sized brain. 

> Copy paste this to someone else's post if you if you think you found someone who is even more dense than you.
