Today I was too tired after driving for 12 hours. I couldn&#8217;t think too much and ended up cleaning up the templates. Removed background colours and made the screen a tad bit cleaner to see.

I also put in a logout button and abstracted out common template pieces to a base template file.

Tomorrow I will probably add in views for adding/editing users. And I am still thinking whether to add an edit screen for entries. Should we be allowed to edit history or not?
