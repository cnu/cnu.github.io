Today I am working on views to add an user. A very simple form which just collects the user&#8217;s Name, Email, password and role. Checks if the email address already exists. If not creates an entry.

I also wanted to display the user details after saving. But I think I wouldn&#8217;t have time to do it. Instead I want to concentrate on deploying a version on Heroku tonight. If I get it deployed before tomorrow&#8217;s standup meeting, we can use this to send the emails instead of manually composing it in gmail.
