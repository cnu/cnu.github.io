Today I am in a place which makes me feel that my old 28kbps dial-up modem feel like super fast fibre internet. This hotel has so many power cuts, Air Conditioner compressor heating issues, hot spicy food that causes abdominal heating issues, etc. I don&#8217;t mind any of those personally, except bad internet. Even hotspot is spotty with just Edge connection. I can&#8217;t believe I am paying so much for this shit.

But I did get some work done. I finished the view function to add a user. I also finished views to display a list of all users and details about a single user.

Right now the details are very sparse, but I will be displaying a user&#8217;s done/todo/blocking tasks for the past N days in this screen. That will be useful to see how a developer has been working.

But for today, this is all I could complete and push.
