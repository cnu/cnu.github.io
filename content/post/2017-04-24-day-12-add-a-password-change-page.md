Thinking of the next important feature that would be asked to make others to use the app is the Password Change screen. Right now, we have 8 users on the app and it was I who set everyone&#8217;s password.Â But soon they would want to change it to something more secure.

<!--more-->

So I quickly wrote a view function which will display a password change form and will also change it if the password and confirm_password fields match. It also logs the user out on successful password change. All of this was made easy because of [Flask-Login][1].

Tomorrow I will be back to my home and would have a much better internet and more time to program.
