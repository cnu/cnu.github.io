They say change is the only constant in life. May be that&#8217;s why I keep changing my blog host and the software.

Initially, cnu.name started off on [nanoc][1] and then I used [Octopress][2]. But I haven&#8217;t been posting anything on it. Partly because I use two computers and I didn&#8217;t get around to configuring octopress and git as I wanted on both the machines.

This time around, I want to try [Ghost][3], mostly because it runs on a server, so I don&#8217;t have to build the blog on my local machine to get it published. And also it is lightweight &#8211; markdown FTW!

I feel even this isn&#8217;t what I have in mind for the perfect blogging software. And I don&#8217;t have the patience to sit and write/maintain my own blog software just to write those 2 or 3 posts a year. So I will stick with Ghost for now.
