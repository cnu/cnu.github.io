Today while talking about stuff that happened at work, wife told an interesting story about two junior level programmers in her office. There are two programmers who have been working on one project their entire career and know almost everything about the project. 

They make sure that any code that they write isn't shared with others in the team. Even after repeatedly asking for help regarding something, they make sure that the actual code that they use isn't shared. In fact, the code they run was written by some senior programmer and all these guys do is run it whenever needed and send the results back by email.

The worst part is, when my wife talked to their manager about this problem, he said "But it is their code right? How can we ask them to give it?" I was like WTF? Who made you the manager and how is the company still profitable? Are you even listening to what you are speaking? 

Things are wrong at so many levels here. Let me write down the basic list of things that are legally expected from you as an employee by your employer.

* Anything that you create during company hours using company resources, belong to the company. The company owns the copyright of any code you write.
