Today while talking about stuff that happened at work, wife told an interesting story about two junior level programmers in her office. There are two programmers who have been working on one project their entire career and know almost everything about the project. 

They make sure that any code that they write isn't shared with others in the team. Even after repeatedly asking for help regarding something, they make sure that the actual code that they use isn't shared. In fact, the code they run was written by some senior programmer and all these guys do is run it whenever needed and send the results back by email.
